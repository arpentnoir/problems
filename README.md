# Programming Praxis Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to problems found on the Programming Praxis blog [here](https://programmingpraxis.com)

My aim is to complete each of the exercises that I attempt in each of the following languages: 

* Java
* Clojure
* Python
* C++
* Javascript

I've tried to aim for a breadth of language paradigms, this list is a start but it might change, or I might get lazy...
